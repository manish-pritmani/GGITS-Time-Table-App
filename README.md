### Why this app ?
When I was in college it used to take a long time and patience to search the photo of time-table in WhatsApp groups, Gallery,roam around Notice Boards to see what's next. So, I felt need to develop a truely connected experience between Students and Specialization Departments.

### Where is the source code ?
Unfortunately, My laptop got BSOD one day and I lost my control over source code of this app. :'(
